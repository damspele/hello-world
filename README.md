# hello-world
Hi Humans!

This is a feature edit added under the feature branch. 
We have two branches now- Readme-Edits and Feature. This branch is all about adding features to the hello-world application.

Damspele here, I am trying to practice using GitHub. Hearing a lot about it, downloading code from it, but never used it.
This is my first repository.
